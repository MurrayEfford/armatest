Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture by Inverse Prediction

This package implements the simulation-based 'inverse prediction' algorithm for fitting tricky spatially explicit capture-recapture models (Efford, 2004; Efford, Dawson and Robbins, 2004). 

The code here is under development. It may be installed using
```
devtools::install_github("MurrayEfford/ipsecr")
```

Compilation of C++ code is required.
